# Wallapp
Random Wallpapers from Unsplash Source API

Wallapp offers 3 random wallpapers for both mobile and desktop resolution on every visit or page refresh. It consumes the Unsplash Source API to get random images. It also offers a well-developed CSS page layout for a smart app with "Dark Mode" & "Light Mode" enabled. 

I just initiate it for learning and testing purposes, maybe later on I will utilize it for sharing my own Unsplash images collection separately. Of course, you can do the same as well, as I share it as an open-source here.

Free to use for commercial and non-commercial purposes ðŸ’¯ <br>
No permission needed (though attribution is appreciated!ðŸ¥°)
